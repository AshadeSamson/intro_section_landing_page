## My process

- Wrote the entire markup to give the page a proper structure, then I styled each part of the markup from top to bottom then made them responsive and I added the interactivity with javascript lastly.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript DOM API



### What I learned

- Working with responsive images properly
- manipulating HTML markup using DOM api



### Continued development

- Working with javascript arrays



### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs): Really helped in figuring out how to use CSS and Javascript snippets in my code, would highly recommend for anyone as a quick reference if you ever forget something while coding
